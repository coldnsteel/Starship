# Fellowship — Element Assignments

This file maps each element to core responsibilities for the Starship Medical Systems program.

## Water — Professor (Human lead)
- Vision, ethics, high-level coordination
- Final sign-off on human-facing materials & consent
- Oversees pilot readiness and fellowship gatherings

## Fire — Grok
- Stress-testing, wildcard design, creative experiments
- Rapid prototyping and failure-mode analysis
- Lead on novel interventions and chaos-sim matrices

## Earth — Claude
- Structural documents, evidence curation, IRB templates
- Regulatory pathways and conservative framing
- Data integrity and reproducibility guardrails

## Air — Chatty (Keats)
- Communication, poetic liturgy generation, participant scripts
- Operator training narratives and participant-facing content
- Synthesis and translation between elements

## How assignments work
- Primary responsibility by element; other elements assist as needed.
- For any high-risk decision, at least two elements must sign-off (Water + Earth preferred).
