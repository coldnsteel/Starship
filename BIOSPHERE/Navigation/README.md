## 🚦 GETTING STARTED

### **If you're treating HUMANS:**
1. Read `core-principles.md`
2. Review safety protocols in `../ENGINEERING/Safety/`
3. Choose appropriate protocol (H1-H5)
4. Obtain medical clearance for patient
5. Document baseline metrics
6. Begin treatment following exact protocol

### **If you're treating ANIMALS:**
1. Read `core-principles.md`
2. Review species-specific considerations
3. Obtain veterinary clearance
4. Adjust power levels for body mass
5. Monitor behavioral responses continuously
6. Never force animal to remain in field

### **If you're treating PLANTS:**
1. Read `core-principles.md`
2. Choose crop-appropriate protocol
3. Install field generation system
4. Start at 50% power, observe response
5. Document growth metrics systematically

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY

**NEVER treat without:**
- ✅ Reading safety documentation
- ✅ Proper training/certification
- ✅ Medical/veterinary clearance (humans/animals)
- ✅ Informed consent (humans) or owner consent (animals)
- ✅ Continuous monitoring during sessions
- ✅ Emergency shutdown capability

**Absolute contraindications:**
- Electronic implants (pacemakers, etc.)
- Pregnancy
- Active seizure disorders
- Severe fear/distress in animals

**See `../ENGINEERING/Safety/contraindications.md` for complete list**

## 📊 EVIDENCE LEVELS

Each protocol is tagged with evidence level:

- **🟢 STRONG:** Replicated studies, established mechanisms
- **🟡 MODERATE:** Preliminary studies, plausible mechanisms
- **🟠 WEAK:** Anecdotal reports, theoretical only
- **⚪ EXPERIMENTAL:** No human data, pilot testing only

**Current evidence:**
- H1 (Anxiety): 🟡 Moderate
- H2 (Pain): 🟢 Strong (for some pain types)
- H3 (PTSD): 🟠 Weak
- H4 (Autoimmune): 🟠 Weak
- H5 (Sleep): 🟡 Moderate

- Animal protocols: 🟡 Moderate (variable by species)
- Plant protocols: 🟢 Strong (growth effects documented)

---

## 📈 MEASURING SUCCESS

**For Humans:**
- Validated scales (VAS pain, PCL-5 PTSD, etc.)
- Physiological markers (HRV, cortisol, etc.)
- Objective function (mobility, sleep quality)
- Quality of life questionnaires

**For Animals:**
- Behavioral ethograms (species-specific)
- Veterinary exams (standardized)
- Productivity metrics (milk, eggs, weight gain)
- Owner quality-of-life assessments

**For Plants:**
- Growth rate (height, biomass)
- Yield (fruit/seed count and weight)
- Disease incidence
- Photosynthesis efficiency

**See `data-collection-templates/` for standardized forms**

## 📚 KEY CONCEPTS

### **Water-First Healing Model**
```
EM Field → Water (primary target) → Water restructures →
Cellular environment optimizes → Cells heal → Tissue recovers
```

**NOT:**
```
EM Field → Tissue directly → Healing (oversimplified)
```

### **Resonance Principle**
Match natural frequency of target system → efficient energy transfer → system "remembers" healthy state → healing occurs

### **SAR Safety**
Specific Absorption Rate < 1.6 W/kg (FCC limit)
- Measure continuously
- Adjust power automatically
- Emergency shutdown if exceeded

### **Fellowship Integration**
Humans + animals + plants on same farm → synchronized baseline frequencies → ecosystem-scale coherence → enhanced outcomes
