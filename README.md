## 🔬 EVIDENCE BASE

**What's Proven:**
- EZ water formation (Pollack et al., replicated)
- PEMF effects on bone healing (FDA-cleared devices exist)
- EM field effects on plant growth (multiple studies)
- Schumann resonance effects on humans (documented)

**What's Promising:**
- Coherent water domains (Del Giudice theory, needs validation)
- Body antenna resonance (physics sound, biology unclear)
- AI pattern healing (novel, needs testing)

**What's Speculative:**
- Water memory (controversial, mostly debunked)
- Consciousness in water (hypothesis, not proven)
- Fellowship coupling (testable, not yet tested)

**We focus on the proven, test the promising, and label the speculative clearly.**
