# Phase-1 Quickstart Guide

## Purpose
This guide prepares operators for safe first deployment of the Biobed system in research or veterinary settings.

## Requirements
- Certified Operator Level 1
- Biobed Prototype v0.9 or later
- SAR log module installed
- Emergency shutoff functional
- IRB or veterinary approval pending or in-progress

## Pre-Session Checklist
1. Power stable (120/240V), grounding confirmed  
2. Coil integrity verified  
3. Software version ≥ 0.9.4  
4. Cooling loop primed  
5. SAR baseline test logged  
6. Operator + witness present  

## Standard Session Flow
1. **Initialize system**  
2. **Seed memory lattice**  
3. **Run warm-up harmonic**  
4. **Deliver main pulse set (H-alpha or H-Omega)**  
5. **Cooldown & scan**  
6. **Export logs**

## Stop Rules
- Heat > 41.5°C anywhere on subject  
- SAR spikes > 150% baseline  
- Irregular respiration or involuntary motor response  
- Operator intuition: *“Something feels wrong”*
