# Phase-1: Standard Research Protocol

## Objective
Evaluate safety, tolerability, and immediate physiological responses to Biobed field exposure.

## Population
- Animals (dogs, cats, goats) or non-human subjects  
- Humans allowed *only* under IRB conditions and DSMB oversight

## Protocol Steps
1. Baseline vitals, imaging (if available)  
2. Positioning + coil alignment  
3. 5–7 minute warm-up harmonic  
4. Main exposure (5–12 minutes)  
5. 3-minute cooldown cycle  
6. Post-session vitals, neurobehavioral check  
7. 24-hour follow-up

## Data to Record
- SAR logs  
- Thermal maps  
- Heart rate, resp rate, motion capture  
- Operator notes (“qualitative markers”)  

## Risk Level
