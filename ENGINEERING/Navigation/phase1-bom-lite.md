# Phase-1 Lightweight Bill of Materials

## Coil + Field Modules
- Copper coil sets (Primary / Secondary)
- High-frequency driver board
- Capacitor bank (rated for target frequency)
- Thermal sensors (IR array recommended)

## Control System
- MCU (Teensy, STM32, or equivalent)
- Power regulation module
- Cooling control relays

## Safety Systems
- Redundant temperature cutoffs  
- Emergency stop button  
- SAR metering subsystem  

## Enclosure
- Non-conductive frame  
- Access panels  
- Radiation shielding (depending on spec)
